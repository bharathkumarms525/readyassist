### CNG Services FAQs

#### How long does the CNG kit installation process take?
The installation process takes between 4 to 6 hours for cars and 7 to 12 days for commercial vehicles. For personal cars, the CNG conversion process is typically completed in a single day, requiring 4-6 hours for proper installation and testing. Commercial vehicles, due to their complexity and size, require a more extensive conversion process that typically spans 7-12 days. This extended timeframe accounts for the additional components, larger fuel systems, and more rigorous testing required for commercial applications. The process includes multiple quality checks and safety verifications to ensure compliance with commercial vehicle standards.

#### Will installing a CNG kit void my vehicle's warranty?
The impact of CNG kit installation on your vehicle's manufacturer warranty varies depending on the specific policies of your vehicle manufacturer and the type of CNG conversion performed. Many modern vehicle manufacturers have specific policies regarding aftermarket modifications, including CNG conversions. Some manufacturers may void certain aspects of the warranty related to the fuel system or engine components if a non-OEM CNG kit is installed, while others may have approved partnerships with CNG conversion providers. It's important to check with your vehicle's manufacturer or authorized dealer before proceeding with any CNG conversion to understand exactly how it might affect your warranty coverage. At CNGFirst, we work with government-approved conversion processes and quality components that meet or exceed safety standards, and we provide our own 1-year warranty on the CNG conversion work. Additionally, we maintain detailed records of all installations and can provide documentation that may be helpful if warranty issues arise. For vehicles where the manufacturer explicitly prohibits CNG conversions, we recommend discussing alternative options with your dealer or considering CNG conversion after the manufacturer's warranty period expires.

#### Is CNG safe to use?
Yes, Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) is considered one of the safest alternative fuels when the installation is performed by certified professionals and regular maintenance protocols are followed. CNG has several inherent safety advantages including a high ignition temperature of approximately 540°C (compared to gasoline's 280°C), making it less likely to ignite accidentally. Additionally, CNG is non-toxic and lighter than air, which means in the event of a leak, it disperses quickly into the atmosphere rather than pooling on the ground like liquid fuels. CNG storage cylinders are manufactured to extremely high safety standards with multiple safety valves and pressure relief devices that prevent over-pressurization. At CNGFirst, all installations are performed by certified technicians who follow strict government safety protocols and use only approved components that meet or exceed national safety standards. Regular maintenance checks ensure that all system components remain in optimal condition, and our technicians provide detailed safety guidelines to help you maintain the system properly. The safety record of properly installed and maintained CNG systems is excellent, with statistically fewer incidents than conventional gasoline or diesel fuel systems.

#### What is the difference between CNG and LPG?
CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) and LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) are both alternative fuels, but they have key differences:
- **Composition**: CNG is mainly methane (CH₄), while LPG consists of propane (C₃H₈) and butane (C₄H₁₀).
- **Storage**: CNG is stored as a gas under high pressure, whereas LPG is stored as a liquid under moderate pressure.
- **Usage**: CNG is primarily used as a vehicle fuel, while LPG is commonly used for cooking, heating, and some vehicles.
- **Safety**: CNG is lighter than air and disperses quickly, making it safer in case of leaks, while LPG is heavier and can accumulate in low areas, increasing explosion risk.
- **Environmental Impact**: CNG has lower emissions and is more eco-friendly compared to LPG.

For vehicles, CNG is preferred due to better mileage and lower emissions, while LPG is ideal for household use like cooking and heating.

#### Where can I refuel my vehicle with CNG?
CNG refueling stations are increasingly available in urban and suburban areas across India, with the network expanding rapidly to support growing demand for cleaner fuel alternatives. Major metropolitan areas such as Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad, and Kolkata have extensive CNG station networks with hundreds of refueling points. You can easily locate the nearest CNG station using our ReadyAssist Website or the ReadyAssist SuperApp, which provide real-time information on station locations, operating hours, and current availability. Our digital platforms feature interactive maps that show your current location and nearby CNG stations, along with directions and estimated travel times. The apps also provide information about station amenities, pricing, and customer reviews to help you choose the most convenient option. For commercial vehicle operators, we offer route planning tools that identify CNG stations along your regular travel routes to ensure uninterrupted operations. Additionally, many CNG stations operate 24/7, providing round-the-clock refueling convenience. We regularly update our station database to reflect new installations and temporary closures, ensuring you always have access to accurate information.

Before installation, we conduct a thorough compatibility check to verify that the components will function properly with your vehicle's electrical system and physical specifications.

We also offer easy EMI options for high-value installations, allowing you to spread the cost over several months with competitive interest rates. Additionally, we provide the option to combine fitment services with ReadyAssist subscription plans, which can offer cost savings and integrated billing.
